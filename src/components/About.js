      <h3>Unlike many other popular news aggregators, inkl focuses on what's "most newsworthy" instead of what's trending. The home page and lead stories are curated by human experts instead of an algorithm, which means you can count on being shown reliable stories of public interest. 

When you sign up for inkl, you'll get a Read first article and intro series that introduces new users to the appâ€”which I thought was a nice touch. You can have the Morning Edition delivered to your inbox every day, and if you're tired of doom and gloom, the app offers a Good news section where you can peruse only positive stories. And Dive deeper sections appear at the end of many articles, inviting you to read more articles related to the topic from a variety of sources.</h3>
